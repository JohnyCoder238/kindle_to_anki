## kindle to anki

One of my earliest projects coded for my personal hobby of learning french from reading books in the original language.
Loading the highlighted phrases and vocabulary from my kindle and then webscraping the translation and accompanying trivia from wictionary to help me more easily remember and learn the words.
The output was to be loaded to the anki flashcards app.
